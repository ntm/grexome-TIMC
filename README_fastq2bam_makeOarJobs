GOAL:
run fastq2bam on a cluster, where the queue system is OAR.


HOW:
In order to run fastq2bam on a cluster such as f-dahu, we need working binaries
of all the programs used by fastq2bam: bwa or bwa-mem2, fastp, samblaster,
samtools, k8 + bwa-postalt.js.
Sometimes they can be installed with tools like nix or guix, but in my case
I found the simplest method is to rebuild each software locally. This also
provides full control on the versions of each software.
I did this for samtools and samblaster.
Software distributed as pre-compiled binaries (bwa-mem2, fastp, k8) worked as-is.

I also wrote fastq2bam_makeOarJobs.pl to submit fastq2bam.pl jobs via OAR,
$samplesPerJob samples at a time.
The script has some hard-coded stuff (paths of FASTQs and paths where BAMs should go,
naming convention for samples == grexomeXXXX, oarsub command and parameters to submit
jobs on our compute cluster, etc...) but may still be useful.


EXAMPLE:
processing FASTQs for samples grexome0809 -> grexome0916 with:
perl Fastq2Bam_PackagedWithBinaries/1_fastq2bam_makeOarJobs.pl 809 916 &> fastq2bam_submitJobs.log
