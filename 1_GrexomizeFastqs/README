Sometimes we get several pairs of FASTQ files for a single sample,
eg when the sample was sequenced on several lanes.
Also, the naming conventions are always different.

This script creates a single pair of "files" (symlinks when possible)
in $outDir for each grexome.

Call eg on luxor in /data/nthierry/PierreRay/FASTQs_All_Grexomized/ ,
see README there for details.
