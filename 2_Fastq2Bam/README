Making my fastq2bam script based on BWA-kit offered by Heng Li, see
~/Software/BWA-kit/ .

Added timestamps to stderr when starting jobs.

Added code to remove HLA files (produced by BWA-kit but I don't use them),
rename the bam, and index it.

Archiving the current/previous version based on BWA-kit in Old/ , 
I am making my own full solution: I already had to make several
patches to bwa-kit, it has a bunch of stuff that I don't want,
and I want to use fastp rather than trimadap for trimming.

After some tests and research, I am running the bw-kit postAlt script.
I am sticking to fastp though.


####################

Improved portability/modularity with --binpath --bwakit --genome.


####################

Improved error handling and logging (eg we check exit status of 
samtools now).

Wrote fastq2bam_makeOarJobs.pl which submits fastq2bam jobs with oar.
Call with 2 int args: first and last , at most 50 grexomes at a time.
Used this on dahu, great!
See ../Fastq2Bam_PackagedWithBinaries_Centos7/ for package, and
luxor:~/PierreRay_DATA/BAMs_grexome_NTM/ for README and bams.
