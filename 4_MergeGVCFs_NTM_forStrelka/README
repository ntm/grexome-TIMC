Starting from ../4_MergeGVCFs_NTM_forGATK/mergeGVCFs.pl , adapting it
to work with Strelka-produced GVCFs.
Strelka uses the condensed GVCF conventions, and some fields are 
different from GATK.

Goal is to parse several strelka-produced condensed GVCFs, and produce
a single GVCF.
I tried https://github.com/Illumina/gvcfgenotyper  but it produces a VCF,
so you have to run it again on all GVCFs whenever you get a new one...
I would rather incrementally rebuild a multi-sample GVCF.

Added a thread running &eatTmpFiles, to consume tmp files in correct 
order and clean up.
Therefore the tmpDir is now automatically emptied and removed when 
we are done.
-> less disk space used, and no slow final "cat".

Compared with previous version: same result (except ##mergeGVCFs=<commandLine=).

Fixed bug where trailing samples without data at a POS were missing!

Seems to work now, but it feels slow... mostly because of the many positions
that should just be no-call but have instead very low counts and one or more
FILTERs.
I am forking a version called mergeGVCFsAndFilter_strelka.pl , where I will
replace any position with a non-PASS filter value by '.' == NOCALL.
Any line where every sample is NOCALL will get skipped.

UPDATE 08/07/2019: DONE, it's much faster and only removing stuff I don't
care about (calls that would be filtered as NOCALL anyways).
Archiving previous version as Old/mergeGVCFs_strelka_190707.pl , 
renaming the new version as simply mergeGVCFs_strelka.pl .

My current code is bottle-necked by the main thread: mainly just reading 
infiles and filtering lines.
I tried to improve the situation by offloading some of the work (mainly
the tab-split of the text lines) to the worker threads, but it's actually
slower.
Moving the attempt into Old/mergeGVCFs_strelka_FailedSpeedupAttempt_190708.pl .

Normalize variants and work around several Strelka bugs.
