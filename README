Exome pipeline frmo TIMC in Grenoble - primary analyses:
from FASTQs to a single multi-sample GVCF per variant-caller.

This pipeline currently performs variant-calling with Strelka2 
or GATK4, 

DEPENDENCIES:
*************
fastp, bwa, samblaster, samtools
gatk4, strelka2

TODO


##### COMMON STEPS FOR STRELKA AND GATK4 #####

0_grexomizeFastqs.pl : house-keeping script that takes 
original fastqs and parses samples.xlsx , to obtain
a consolidated uniform dataset of fastqs.

2_Fastq2Bam/ : process fastqs: trim adaptors, align on ref genome,
mark duplicates, sort bam, index bam.


##### SPECIFIC STEPS FOR STRELKA #####

3_Bam2Gvcf_Strelka/ : variant calling with strelka, produces one GVCF
per sample.

4_MergeGVCFs/ : merge several single- or multi-sample GVCFs to obtain 
a single multi-sample GVCF, and along the way: filter low-quality 
variants, normalize variants, and clean up everything.


##### SPECIFIC STEPS FOR GATK4 #####

3_Bam2Gvcf_GATK/ : variant calling with GATK4, produces one GVCF
per sample.

4_GVCFs2GenomicsDB/ : import single-sample GATK GVCFs into a GenomicsDB.

5_GenomicsDB2VCF/ : perform joint genotyping with GATK GenotypeGVCFs 
from a GenomicsDB.


##### "PACKAGED" VERSIONS FOR RUNNING SOME STEPS ON CLUSTERS #####

Fastq2Bam_PackagedWithBinaries_Centos7/ :
Bam2gvcf_Strelka_PackagedWithBinaries_Centos7/ :
Bam2gvcf_GATK_PackagedWithBinaries_Centos7/ :
"packages" for running fastq2bam, bam2gvcf_strelka, or bam2gvcf_gatk 
on other systems, eg f-dahu. Each subdir has its README.
