Primary analysis pipeline: from FASTQs to a single multi-sample 
GVCF (Strelka pipeline) or VCF (GATK4 pipeline).


##### COMMON STEPS FOR STRELKA AND GATK4 #####

1_GrexomizeFastqs/ : house-keeping script:
take original fastqs and parse patient_summary_*.xlsx , to obtain
a consolidated uniform dataset of fastqs, see
luxor:/data/nthierry/PierreRay/FASTQs_All_Grexomized

2_Fastq2Bam/ : process fastqs: trim adaptors, align on ref genome,
mark duplicates, sort bam, index bam.


##### SPECIFIC STEPS FOR STRELKA #####

3_Bam2Gvcf_Strelka/ : variant calling with strelka, produces one GVCF
per sample.

4_MergeGVCFs_NTM_forStrelka/ : merge several single- or multi-sample
GVCFs to obtain a single multi-sample GVCF, and along the way: filter
low-quality variants, normalize variants, and clean up everything.


##### SPECIFIC STEPS FOR GATK4 #####

3_Bam2Gvcf_GATK/ : variant calling with GATK4, produces one GVCF
per sample.

4_GVCFs2GenomicsDB/ : import single-sample GATK GVCFs into a GenomicsDB.

5_GenomicsDB2VCF/ : perform joint genotyping with GATK GenotypeGVCFs 
from a GenomicsDB.


##### "PACKAGED" VERSIONS FOR RUNNING SOME STEPS ON CLUSTERS #####

Fastq2Bam_PackagedWithBinaries_Centos7/ :
Bam2gvcf_Strelka_PackagedWithBinaries_Centos7/ :
Bam2gvcf_GATK_PackagedWithBinaries_Centos7/ :
"packages" for running fastq2bam, bam2gvcf_strelka, or bam2gvcf_gatk 
on other systems, eg f-dahu. Each subdir has its README.
