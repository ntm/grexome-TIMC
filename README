Primary analysis pipeline: from FASTQs to a single multi-sample GVCF.


1_GrexomizeFastqs/ : house-keeping script:
take original fastqs and parse patient_summary_*.xlsx , to obtain
a consolidated uniform dataset of fastqs, see
luxor:/data/nthierry/PierreRay/FASTQs_All_Grexomized

2_Fastq2Bam/ : process fastqs: trim adaptors, align on ref genome,
mark duplicates, sort bam, index bam.

3_Bam2Gvcf_Strelka/ : variant calling with strelka, produces one GVCF
per sample.

3_Bam2Gvcf_GATK/ : variant calling with GATK4, produces one GVCF
per sample.

4_MergeGVCFs_NTM_forStrelka/ : merge several single- or multi-sample
GVCFs to obtain a single multi-sample GVCF, and along the way: filter
low-quality variants, normalize variants, and clean up everything.



Fastq2Bam_PackagedWithBinaries_Centos7/ :
Bam2gvcf_Strelka_PackagedWithBinaries_Centos7/ :
Bam2gvcf_GATK_PackagedWithBinaries_Centos7/ :
"packages" for running fastq2bam, bam2gvcf_strelka, or bam2gvcf_gatk 
on other systems, eg f-dahu. Each subdir has its README.
